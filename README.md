# Anteka's Gear Analyzer
A kinda slow but fast enough gear analyzer for EpicSeven.

It does generally work better on higher resolutions.

You can find the latest builds under [Releases](https://github.com/cjAnteka/AntekaGearAnalyzer/releases).

## Known Issues
* Doesn't currently support i88 or i90 gear
* Doesn't support oddly-sized instances (maximized on a vertical monitor, for instance)
* Will occasionally assign existing rolls incorrectly
* Will occasionally calculate reforge stats incorrectly
* The error handling is actually ass

## How to Use
Click on the "Select" button, then click on the display area of your emulator.
You should see a name like "HD-Player" or "TheRenderer" in the text box next to the "Select" button.

Go to the enhance page of any piece of gear and click the big "Check" button.
